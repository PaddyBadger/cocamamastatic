			<h4><a name="women">We believe in Women.</a></h4>

			<p>We believe that women have not only the power, but also a duty to reach their full potential, and to live happy, fulfilling lives.</p>
			<p>We believe that by going one step further, each woman not only creates a better live for herself, for her family and for her friends, but for women like her all over the world.</p>
			<p>Sheryl Sandberg's fabulous book, Lean In, delivers the philosophy that if and when more women reach the top, and work to be in the best position that they can be, they will be able to change the world for other women, all over the world. This is why Cocamama is here - to help women get into the best position that they can.</p>
			
			<h4><a name="you">We believe that it starts with you.</a></h4>
	
			<p>You are the person with whom your personal wellbeing, achievements, dreams and happiness begin and end. You are the person who knows what you want, why you want it, and most likely, how to get it.</p>

			<p>We are here to help you figure all of those things out, and to guide you with some of the small steps in getting there.</p>

			<h4><a name="others">We believe in others.</a></h4>

 			<p>We believe that surrounding yourself with the right people is fundamental to success. Cocamama is here to put you together with other women who can inspire and support you, and who you can inspire and support.

 			We are building a strong community of women striving to achieve their goals, who will help each other, and by helping each other, will change the world for women everywhere.</p>

			<h4><a name="action">We believe in action with direction.</a></h4>

			<p>We believe that everyone has goals, ambitions and wants. We believe that to get anywhere with these goals, ambitions and wants, there must be planning, and there must be action.</p>

			<p>As the Japanese proverb goes, 'Vision without action is a daydream. Action without vision is a nightmare.' To achieve your goals, you must first know what they are, and then take action to work towards them.</p>
			<p>At Cocamama, we believe that everyone should be aware of and working towards their biggest 5 life goals on an ongoing basis. </p>
			<p>We believe that the world's most effective people dream big, start small, and set measurable goals for themselves.</p>

			<h4><a name="believe">We believe that you need to believe.</a></h4>

			<p>We believe in you. We believe that you should believe in you. Henry Ford famously said, 'Whether you think you can or can't, you're probably right', we are here to help you to think you can.</p>
